UNIT – 2 
Experiment 2.1: 
Aim: Write a Python program that defines a Car class with a ributes like make, model, and 
year, and methods like start() and stop().  
Descrip on: Demonstrates object-oriented programming by crea ng a Car class with 
a ributes and methods to simulate star ng and stopping.  
Procedure:  
1. Start the program.  
2. Define Car class with a ributes make, model, year.  
3. Define start() and stop() methods.  
4. Create object with specific values.  
5. Call methods.  
6. End the program.  
Source Code:  
class Car:  
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):  
         self.make = make  
         self.model = model  
         self.year = year  
   def start(self):  
         print(f"{self.make} {self.model} is star ng.")  
   def stop(self): print(f"{self.make} {self.model} is stopping.")  
my_car = Car("Toyota","Corolla",2020)  
my_car.start()  
my_car.stop()  
Input and Output:  
Input: None  
Output: Toyota Corolla is star ng. Toyota Corolla is stopping.  
Result: Class and method execu on demonstrated correctly. 
Experiment 2.2: 
Aim: Write a Python program that demonstrates inheritance by crea ng a base class Animal 
and derived classes like Dog, Cat, etc., each with their specific behaviors 
Descrip on:  
Derived classes inherit a ributes and methods from a base class and can override them. 
Procedure / Logic:  
1. Start the program.  
2. Define base class Animal with speak().  
3. Define derived classes Dog, Cat and override speak().  
4. Create objects and call methods.  
5. End the program. 
Source Code: 
class Animal:  
def speak(self):  
print("Animal makes a sound")  
class Dog(Animal):  
def speak(self):  
print("Dog barks")  
class Cat(Animal):  
def speak(self):  
print("Cat meows")  
dog = Dog()  
cat = Cat()  
dog.speak()  
cat.speak() 
Input and Output:  
Input: None  
Output:  
Dog barks  
Cat meows 
Result: Inheritance and method overriding demonstrated. 
Experiment 2.3: 
Aim: Define a base class called Animal with a method make_sound(). Implement derived 
classes Dog, Cat, Bird that override make_sound() to produce different sounds.  
Descrip on: Calling the same method on objects of different classes produces different 
outputs.  
Procedure:  
1. Start program.  
2. Define base class Animal with make_sound().  
3. Define derived classes Dog, Cat, Bird overriding method.  
4. Create objects.  
5. Call method on each object.  
6. End program.  
Source Code:  
class Animal:  
     def make_sound(self):  
          print("Some sound")  
class Dog(Animal):  
     def make_sound(self):  
          print("Bark")  
class Cat(Animal):  
     def make_sound(self):  
          print("Meow")  
class Bird(Animal):  
    def make_sound(self):  
         print("Chirp")  
animals=[Dog(),Cat(),Bird()]  
for animal in animals:  
    animal.make_sound()  
  
Input and Output:  
Input: None  
Output:  
Bark  
Meow  
Chirp  
Result: Polymorphism demonstrated correctly. 
Program 2.4: 
Aim: Write a Python program that demonstrates error handling using try-except block to 
handle division by zero.  
Descrip on: Prevents runme errors using try-except block.  
Procedure:  
1. Start program.  
2. Prompt user for numerator and denominator.  
3. Use try to perform division.  
4. Use except to catch ZeroDivisionError.  
5. Display result if valid.  
6. End program.  
Source Code:  
try:  
num1=int(input("Enter numerator: "))  
num2=int(input("Enter denominator: "))  
result=num1/num2  
print("Result:",result)  
except ZeroDivisionError:  
print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")  
Input and Output:  
Input:  
Enter numerator:10  
Enter denominator:0  
Output: Error: Division by zero is not allowed.  
Result: Program handles division by zero successfully
